Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, leading to substantial financial losses for both financial institutions and cardholders. This repository provides a Credit Card Fraud Detection system implemented using the Decision Tree algorithm. Decision trees are powerful tools for classification tasks, making them suitable for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.<br><br>

In this README file, you'll find information on how to use and deploy this system to identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions.<br><br>

## Dataset

To train and test the Decision Tree model, we use the following dataset:<br><br>

Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset: This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders. It is highly imbalanced, with a vast majority of transactions being non-fraudulent. The dataset includes various features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized numerical input features. You can find the dataset here.****<br>
Please download and place this dataset in a directory named "data" within the project folder.<br><br>
