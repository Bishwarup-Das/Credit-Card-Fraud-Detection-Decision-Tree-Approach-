Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, leading to substantial financial losses for both financial institutions and cardholders. This repository provides a Credit Card Fraud Detection system implemented using the Decision Tree algorithm. Decision trees are powerful tools for classification tasks, making them suitable for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.<br><br>

In this README file, you'll find information on how to use and deploy this system to identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions.<br><br>

## Dataset

To train and test the Decision Tree model, we use the following dataset:<br><br>

Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset: This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders. It is highly imbalanced, with a vast majority of transactions being non-fraudulent. The dataset includes various features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized numerical input features. You can find the dataset here.****<br>
Please download and place this dataset in a directory named "data" within the project folder.<br><br>

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps: <br><br>

<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:</li>
  <code>
    git clone https://github.com/Bishwarup-Das/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Decision-Tree-Approach-.git<br>
    cd credit-card-fraud-detection
  </code><br><br>
  <li>Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):</li>
  <code>
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
  </code><br><br>
  <li>install the required dependencies:</li>
  <code>
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  </code><br><br>
</ol>


## Usage

To train and use the Decision Tree model for credit card fraud detection, follow these steps:<br><br>
<ol>
  <li>Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.</li>
  <li>Make sure you have placed the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset in the "data" directory as mentioned in the Dataset section </li>
  <li>Run the Jupyter notebook credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb. This notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, model   training, evaluation, and prediction.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions and code within the notebook to train the Decision Tree model and make predictions.</li>
</ol><br><br>

## Results

After training and evaluating the Decision Tree model, you can expect to see the following results:<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>Confusion matrix</li>
  <li>Precision, recall, and F1-score</li>
  <li>Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve</li>
  <li>Area Under the Curve (AUC) score</li>
  <li>These metrics will help you assess the performance of the model in detecting credit card fraud.</li>
</ul><br><br>
