Introduction

Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, leading to substantial financial losses for both financial institutions and cardholders. This repository provides a Credit Card Fraud Detection system implemented using the Decision Tree algorithm. Decision trees are powerful tools for classification tasks, making them suitable for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.

In this README file, you'll find information on how to use and deploy this system to identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions.

Dataset

To train and test the Decision Tree model, we use the following dataset:

Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset: This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders. It is highly imbalanced, with a vast majority of transactions being non-fraudulent. The dataset includes various features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized numerical input features. You can find the dataset here.
Please download and place this dataset in a directory named "data" within the project folder.
